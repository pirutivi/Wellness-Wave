            <h2>Macronutrients</h2>
            <p>Macronutrients are the major nutrients required by the body in large amounts to provide energy and support various physiological functions. The three main macronutrients are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Each plays a crucial role in the body's metabolism, energy production, and overall health.</p>

            <h2>Micronutrients</h2>
            <p>Micronutrients are tiny nutrients the body needs in small doses to stay healthy and avoid shortages. They include important vitamins like A, B, C, D, E, and K, as well as minerals such as iron, calcium, magnesium, and zinc. These little helpers are super important for things like keeping our immune system strong, keeping our bones healthy, and helping our cells work properly.</p>

            <h2>Dietary Patterns</h2>
            <p>Dietary patterns mean the types of foods people eat. They can really affect how healthy we are. For example, the Mediterranean diet is about eating lots of plants, healthy fats, and some lean protein. Vegetarian and vegan diets avoid or limit animal products. Then there are diets like Paleo or keto, which focus on certain foods or how much of each type of food we eat.</p>

            <h2>Health Conditions and Nutrition</h2>
            <p>Good nutrition helps keep us healthy and can even help us manage health problems. It looks at how what we eat affects diseases like diabetes, heart issues, obesity, high blood pressure, and stomach problems. By knowing how food choices impact these conditions, we can suggest better diets to help people feel better.</p>
